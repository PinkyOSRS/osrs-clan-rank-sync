logic of this repo:

uploads/ contains .json files uploaded by multiple admins of the OSRS clan through the runelite plugin "Clanmate Export" with the URL https://osrs-clan-rank-uploader.onrender.com/clanrank

.github/workflows/process-clan-ranks.yml checks for newest upload in uploads/ and runs that most current memberlist through process_clan_ranks.py

this creates a parsed output of the most up to date clanmember list under the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PinkyOSRS/osrs-clan-rank-sync/main/clan_ranks_for_bot.json

the formating of this list is:

{
  "EXAMPLE RSN": {
    "rank": "EXAMPLE RANK",
    "joinedDate": "EXAMPLE DATE"
  },
}


this list is used for various purposes
